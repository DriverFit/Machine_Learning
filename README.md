# Machine_Learning 

Machine learning takes part in building the model for classifying images. We build the model using TensorFlow to classify images to active or fatigue. We export the model with TensorFlow lite.

# Dataset
Labeled images in two folders, fatigue and active.

# Documentation
1. Import the dataset to ipynb.

3. Preprocessing the data. (In our case the data is already clean)
4. Try to build the model with some layers.
5. Compile the model.
6. Testing the model with some pictures.
